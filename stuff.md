## STUFF

# Bugs

- the top bar search bar must go
- CRDs only showing 3 basic columns
- there's no indication when the result is empty, the spinner keeps spinning
- when in the logs view in details, if i click on another pod from the results, the logs do no change, i still se the ones from the previously selected pod. clicking stoop and then start gets the new ones, but it would be nice if this happened automatically
- in the details view, while typing in a typable area, if i click a button that belongs to a shortcut, the shortcut is fired and the focus changes. basically barring some charachters to be typed

- sometimes the results view remains filteres on a namespace and it's not clear why. i think a dropdown menu (maybe searchable and with checkboxes) to show current seletected namespace(s) would help

- the Virtual table view of the results is visually broken
  


# Features

- clicking on a namespace in the results area should filter by namespace 
- in the results area, there should be a namespace dropdown selector, filterable and with multi checkbox for multiple namespaces
- add yaml syntax highlight to `egui_code_editor`
