# Security Policy

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please do not file a public issue.
Instead, email the maintainer privately. We’ll acknowledge, investigate, and
publish fixes promptly.

Scope: this is an early alpha. Avoid running against clusters you cannot
afford to break. Operations like scale/delete/cordon/drain are guarded but
ultimately do what you ask.
